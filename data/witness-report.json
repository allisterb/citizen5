	"Text": "The UPC and Bira attacked in three groups, about 500 of them, coming from three different directions.  They had military uniforms.  Most of them were UPC. Commander Bagonza ordered the troops to attack Songolo.  He was there himself; I saw him.  They were together with Bira in civilian clothes who had machetes and spears.  In the center of Songolo there was a clash between Ngiti fighters and the UPC and Bira.  They used mortars and rockets.  We saw this from where we were, at the bottom of the hill.  Nine Ngiti combatants were killed and more than twenty Hema/UPC. Then the Bira combatants guided the UPC to the houses. They killed people, most with bullets, others with machetes and spears.  I saw mostly old people killed.  Some were attacked in their sleep, including children and women.  The Bira combatants also decapitated some people with machetes.  There were 140 dead, including many women and children. We asked people to come out of the bush to bury the dead.  We took turns doing the burial",
